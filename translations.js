Someone who constantly strives to better himself through knowledge. These are the words that best represent him.`,
        testimonial4: "Working with Ch3f has always been a pleasure. He is an incredibly kind and professional creator. He took one of my ideas, which I thought would be difficult to realize, and turned it into something much bigger and of higher quality than I expected. One aspect I really appreciate is his commitment to supporting multiple languages, which allows me to use his creations in my native language, even though I have no technical skills. I am truly grateful for his work and I hope to see more and more amazing projects on his site!",
        
        testimonialsTitle: "What people say about me",
        testimonial1: `Ch3f is an amazing artist, a kind and welcoming friend, and an excellent content creator. He is consistently trying to improve and widen the appeal and accessibility of his channel to everyone, no matter where they may come from, even outside his own country. With active translation both for his own speech to viewers, as well as options for chatters to communicate back in both their own native language, as well as his native Italian, I have never hesitated to say hello, or recommend his stream to everyone I know.
        These traits also extend to Ch3f's offline presence, where he is ready and willing to accept commissions for artwork and stream graphics/overlays/etc, to simply creating assets for other creators to use freely, with easy to use graphics and multiple options to reduce lag and CPU load.
        Ch3f is a very cool guy and I'm honored to know him and be able to call him a friend. Anything I can do to help him achieve his goals, I will gladly provide.`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f is a wonderful and creative friend, even though he lives on the other side of the world. When I first met him there was a small language barrier, but he was determined and quickly found a way to communicate with friends and viewers using a translation app that turns his voice into English in real time! Ch3f also personally helped me in my streaming career by creating a custom music widget with my model. He is a very hard-working person who always gives his best in every commission and project he works on. His personal and creative growth is truly impressive: he constantly updates his model with personal touches and fresh ideas, making every stream more engaging and showing all his graphic talents through overlays, transitions, and much more.`,

It’s also Twitch, where every evening turns into a moment to share.My streams aren’t just live broadcasts they’re like those hangouts at a friend’s house: unfiltered, unscripted, and most of all, not too serious.My Twitch journey started thanks to Ilaria and Tia, who I met through GTA V roleplay.Ilaria, playing the legendary “Dr. Chang” a quirky Chinese granny in her 60s made her mark with the iconic greeting: “ehhh cisiao belli”, a unique entrance that instantly charmed everyone.Tia played one of Dr. Chang’s many daughters, always ready to stir up chaos with sharp jokes and friendly insults that have now become our trademark language.Other people join us sometimes and stay for a while, but in the end, the true heart of the madness is the Chang Gang: me, Ilaria, and Tia. That’s our real crew our creative family.Together, we’re a bunch of wild creatives, playing, laughing, and sharing raw, unfiltered moments.",
            introvision: "This site is my creative hub, but also the space where I show how my vision of creativity goes beyond design: it’s a mix of passion, freedom, and authenticity just like our nights together.Because between an asset and a laugh, what really matters is staying true to yourself.",

        这些品质也体现在线下，他乐于接受艺术和直播图形的委托，也会为其他创作者免费制作易用且优化的资源，减少延迟和CPU占用。
        Ch3f真的是个很棒的人，能称他为朋友我感到很荣幸。我会一直尽力帮助他实现目标。`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f 是一位非常棒且有创意的朋友，即使他住在世界的另一端。刚认识他时有点语言障碍，但他很有决心，很快就通过一个能实时把他的声音翻译成英文的翻译应用，找到了和朋友及观众沟通的方法！Ch3f 还亲自帮我做了一个和我的模型配套的自定义音乐小工具，对我的主播生涯帮助很大。他是个非常勤奋的人，每次接单和做项目都全力以赴。他的个人和创意成长真的很令人印象深刻：他不断用个人风格和新点子更新自己的模型，让每次直播都更有趣，通过各种叠加、转场等展示了他所有的美术才华。`,

Qualcuno che cerca costantemente di migliorarsi attraverso la conoscenza. Queste sono le parole che lo rappresentano meglio.`,

        testimonial1: `Ch3f è un artista straordinario, un amico gentile e accogliente, e un eccellente content creator. Cerca costantemente di migliorare e rendere il suo canale accessibile a tutti, ovunque si trovino, anche fuori dall’Italia. Con traduzioni attive sia per il suo parlato che per la chat, non ho mai esitato a salutare o a raccomandare il suo stream a chiunque conosca.
        Queste qualità si riflettono anche offline, dove è sempre pronto ad accettare commissioni per artwork e grafiche, oppure a creare asset gratuiti per altri creator, con grafiche facili da usare e ottimizzate per ridurre il carico su CPU e lag.
        Ch3f è davvero una bella persona e sono onorato di poterlo chiamare amico. Farò sempre il possibile per aiutarlo a raggiungere i suoi obiettivi.`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f è un amico meraviglioso e creativo, anche se vive dall'altra parte del mondo. Quando l'ho conosciuto per la prima volta c'era una piccola barriera linguistica, ma lui era determinato e ha trovato subito un modo per comunicare con amici e spettatori usando un'app di traduzione che trasforma la sua voce in inglese in tempo reale! Ch3f mi ha anche aiutato personalmente nella mia carriera da streamer creando un widget musicale personalizzato con il mio modello. È una persona molto laboriosa che dà sempre il massimo in ogni commissione e progetto a cui lavora. La sua crescita personale e creativa è davvero impressionante: aggiorna costantemente il suo modello con tocchi personali e idee fresche, rendendo ogni live più coinvolgente e mostrando tutti i suoi talenti grafici tramite overlay, transizioni e molto altro.`,

Questo è il nostro vero team, il nostro punto di riferimento.Insieme, siamo una squadra di pazzi creativi, che gioca, ride e condivide ogni momento senza filtri.",

Quelqu’un qui cherche constamment à s’améliorer grâce au savoir. Ce sont les mots qui le représentent le mieux.`,
        testimonial4: "Travailler avec Ch3f a toujours été un plaisir. C'est un créateur incroyablement gentil et professionnel. Il a pris une de mes idées, que je pensais difficile à réaliser, et l'a transformée en quelque chose de bien plus grand et de meilleure qualité que ce à quoi je m'attendais. Un aspect que j'apprécie énormément est son engagement à supporter plusieurs langues, ce qui me permet d'utiliser ses créations dans ma langue maternelle, même sans compétences techniques. Je suis vraiment reconnaissant pour son travail et j'espère voir de plus en plus de projets fantastiques sur son site !",
        
        testimonial1: `Ch3f est un artiste incroyable, un ami gentil et accueillant, et un excellent créateur de contenu. Il cherche constamment à améliorer et à rendre sa chaîne accessible à tous, où qu'ils soient, même en dehors de son pays. Avec la traduction active de ses paroles et des options pour que le chat communique dans leur langue natale ou en italien, je n'ai jamais hésité à le saluer ou à recommander son stream à tous mes amis.
        Ces qualités se retrouvent aussi hors ligne, où il accepte volontiers des commandes graphiques ou crée des assets gratuits pour d'autres créateurs, avec des graphismes faciles à utiliser et optimisés pour réduire la charge CPU et le lag.
        Ch3f est vraiment quelqu’un de bien et je suis honoré de l’appeler mon ami. Je ferai toujours tout mon possible pour l’aider à atteindre ses objectifs.`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f est un ami merveilleux et créatif, même s'il vit à l'autre bout du monde. Lorsque je l'ai rencontré pour la première fois, il y avait une petite barrière linguistique, mais il était déterminé et a rapidement trouvé un moyen de communiquer avec ses amis et spectateurs grâce à une application de traduction qui transforme sa voix en anglais en temps réel ! Ch3f m'a également aidé personnellement dans ma carrière de streamer en créant un widget musical personnalisé avec mon modèle. C'est une personne très travailleuse qui donne toujours le meilleur de lui-même dans chaque commande et projet sur lequel il travaille. Sa croissance personnelle et créative est vraiment impressionnante : il met constamment à jour son modèle avec des touches personnelles et des idées fraîches, rendant chaque live plus captivant et montrant tous ses talents graphiques à travers des overlays, des transitions et bien plus encore.`,

C'est notre vrai équipe, notre point de référence.Ensemble, nous sommes une équipe de créatifs fous, qui jouent, rient et partagent chaque moment sans filtres。",

Tomó una de mis ideas, que pensé que sería difícil de realizar, y la convirtió en algo mucho más grande y de mayor calidad de lo que esperaba. Un aspecto que valoro mucho es su compromiso con el soporte de múltiples idiomas, lo que me permite usar sus creaciones en mi idioma nativo, aunque no tenga conocimientos técnicos.

Con traducción activa tanto para su propio discurso como para el chat, nunca he dudado en saludarlo o recomendar su stream a todos mis conocidos.
        Estas cualidades también se ven fuera de línea, donde está dispuesto a aceptar encargos de arte y gráficos, o simplemente crear assets gratuitos para otros creadores, con gráficos fáciles de usar y optimizados para reducir el lag y el uso de CPU.
        Ch3f es una gran persona y me honra poder llamarlo amigo. Siempre haré lo posible por ayudarlo a alcanzar sus metas.`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f es un amigo maravilloso y creativo, aunque viva al otro lado del mundo. Cuando lo conocí por primera vez había una pequeña barrera idiomática, pero él estaba decidido y rápidamente encontró una forma de comunicarse con amigos y espectadores usando una app de traducción que convierte su voz en inglés en tiempo real. ¡Ch3f también me ayudó personalmente en mi carrera de streamer creando un widget musical personalizado con mi modelo!

Mit aktiver Übersetzung sowohl für seine eigene Sprache als auch für den Chat habe ich nie gezögert, Hallo zu sagen oder seinen Stream jedem zu empfehlen, den ich kenne.
        Diese Eigenschaften zeigen sich auch offline, wo er bereit ist, Aufträge für Artwork und Stream-Grafiken anzunehmen oder einfach kostenlose Assets für andere Creator zu erstellen, mit einfach zu verwendenden Grafiken und mehreren Optionen zur Reduzierung von Lag und CPU-Auslastung.

Ch3f hat mir auch persönlich in meiner Streamer-Karriere geholfen, indem er ein individuelles Musik-Widget mit meinem Modell erstellt hat. Er ist ein sehr fleißiger Mensch, der bei jedem Auftrag und Projekt immer sein Bestes gibt.

        introwelcome: "Willkommen in meiner Welt.Ich heiße CH3F und dies ist mein kreativer Raum, in dem ich digitale Kunst, Grafiken für Content Creator und meine Leidenschaft für die Nerd-Welt vereine, um eine Mischung zu schaffen, die meine Geschichte und die der anderen erzählt。",
        introassets: "Ich erstelle maßgeschneiderte Grafiken: Banner, Logos, animierte GIFs, Grafiken für Events und Communities. Jedes Projekt entsteht mit einer klaren Absicht: nützliche Inhalte zu bieten, die aber auch die Persönlichkeit derer widerspiegeln, die sie verwenden. Für mich ist Grafik mehr als nur Ästhetik: Sie ist Identität。",
        introtwitch: "🎮 Aber mein Raum ist nicht nur Grafik. Er ist auch Twitch, wo jeder Abend zu einem Moment wird, den man teilen kann.Meine Streams sind keine gewöhnlichen Live-Übertragungen: Sie sind wie die Abende unter Freunden zu Hause, ohne Filter, ohne Skript und vor allem ohne sich zu ernst zu nehmen.Meine Reise auf Twitch begann durch Ilaria und Tia, die ich im GTA V Roleplay-Universum kennenlernte.Ilaria, die die legendäre „Doktorin Chang“ spielte, eine über 60-jährige chinesische alte Dame, machte ihren unverwechselbaren Gruß „ehhh cisiao belli“ berühmt – eine einzigartige Art, hereinzukommen, die alle eroberte.Tia war hingegen eine der unzähligen Töchter der Doktorin, immer bereit, Chaos mit scharfsinnigen Witzen und liebevollen Beleidigungen zu entfachen, die nun Teil unserer Sprache sind.Und dann gibt es noch andere Leute, die sich manchmal zu uns gesellen, eine Weile bleiben, aber am Ende bleibt der wahre Kern dieses Wahnsinns immer die Chang Gang: ich, Ilaria und Tia. Das ist unser wahres Team, unser Bezugspunkt.Zusammen sind wir ein Team von verrückten Kreativen, die spielen, lachen und jeden Moment ohne Filter teilen。",
        introvision: "Diese Seite ist mein kreativer Hub, aber auch der Ort, an dem ich zeige, wie meine kreative Vision über Design hinausgeht: Sie ist eine Mischung aus Leidenschaft, Freiheit und Authentizität, genau wie unsere Abende.Denn zwischen einem Asset und einem Lachen geht es vor allem darum, sich selbst treu zu bleiben。",

Alguém que está sempre buscando se aprimorar através do conhecimento. Essas são as palavras que melhor o representam.`,
        testimonial4: "Trabalhar com o Ch3f sempre foi um prazer. Ele é um criador incrivelmente gentil e profissional. Ele pegou uma ideia minha, que eu achava difícil de realizar, e transformou em algo muito maior e de qualidade superior ao que eu esperava. Um aspecto que aprecio muito é o seu compromisso em suportar vários idiomas, o que me permite usar suas criações no meu idioma nativo, mesmo sem ter conhecimentos técnicos. Sou realmente grato pelo seu trabalho e espero ver cada vez mais projetos incríveis em seu site!",

        testimonial1: `Ch3f é um artista incrível, um amigo gentil e acolhedor, e um excelente criador de conteúdo. Ele está sempre tentando melhorar e tornar seu canal acessível a todos, não importa de onde venham, até mesmo fora do seu país. Com tradução ativa tanto para sua fala quanto para o chat, nunca hesitei em cumprimentá-lo ou recomendar sua stream para todos que conheço.
        Essas qualidades também se estendem ao offline, onde ele está pronto para aceitar encomendas de arte e gráficos, ou simplesmente criar assets gratuitos para outros criadores, com gráficos fáceis de usar e várias opções para reduzir lag e uso de CPU.
        Ch3f é uma pessoa muito legal e tenho orgulho de chamá-lo de amigo. Sempre farei o possível para ajudá-lo a alcançar seus objetivos.`,
        testimonial2: `Ch3f é um amigo maravilhoso e criativo, mesmo morando do outro lado do mundo. Quando o conheci pela primeira vez havia uma pequena barreira linguística, mas ele foi determinado e rapidamente encontrou uma maneira de se comunicar com amigos e espectadores usando um aplicativo de tradução que transforma sua voz em inglês em tempo real! Ch3f também me ajudou pessoalmente na minha carreira de streamer criando um widget musical personalizado com meu modelo. Ele é uma pessoa muito trabalhadora que sempre dá o seu melhor em cada comissão e projeto em que trabalha. Seu crescimento pessoal e criativo é realmente impressionante: ele atualiza constantemente seu modelo com toques pessoais e ideias novas, tornando cada live mais envolvente e mostrando todos os seus talentos gráficos através de overlays, transições e muito mais.`,
